Place the admin profile photos here for self-hosted avatar delivery:
- /admins/lio.png
- /admins/ellina.png

The app now loads these local paths first via `${PUBLIC_URL}/admins/...`.

When deployed under a subpath, these files are served from `${PUBLIC_URL}/admins/...` (for example, `/myapp/admins/lio.png`).
