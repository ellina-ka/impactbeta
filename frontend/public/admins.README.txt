Place the admin profile photos here for self-hosted avatar delivery:
- /admins/lio.png
- /admins/ellina.png

The app loads these local paths via `${PUBLIC_URL}/admins/...` and appends a version query string (`?v=...`) for cache busting.

If you still see old avatars after deploy, set `REACT_APP_ADMIN_ASSET_VERSION` to a new value during build (for example a timestamp or commit SHA).

When deployed under a subpath, these files are served from `${PUBLIC_URL}/admins/...` (for example, `/myapp/admins/lio.png`).
